# bikesharing
In this module, I worked with data visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. 

I learned how to import, style, and portray data accurately. Then, created worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset.

Use Tableau worksheets to display and portray data accurately using Tableau dashboards.
