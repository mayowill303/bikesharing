# Bikesharing Investment
In this module, I worked with data visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company. 

I learned how to import, style, and portray data accurately. Then, created worksheets, dashboards, and stories to visualize key data from a New York Citi Bike dataset.

Use Tableau worksheets to display and portray data accurately using Tableau dashboards.

# Overview of our Analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to find out if the bike rental business is worth investing in. Some of the key factors we look at is tripduration, times of rentals and genders of riders. Understanding how long the trips are in August will provide insight on when the bikes are rented, for how long, and who are the majority of renters.

# Results:
- There was a total of 2,344,224 rides in the month of August.
- Out of the total trips 1.9m+ users subscribe to the company and 443.8k users are customers.
- The peak number of users who rent their bike are for 5-6 hour trips.
- Males have been the majority of users.
- Thursday between 5pm-7pm is the most popular time to ride a bike, followed by 8a.

# Summary

The bike sharing business appears lucrative with so many riders for the month of August.  it's more popular in more urban areas than rural or suburban neighborhoods.  The increasing popularity may be linked to lack of available parking and cost of car transport in more downtown areas.  The users tended to lean more male though female usage has been increasing.  Riders tended to ride mostly Thursdays in morning around 8a and evening between 5p and 7p.

Some additional analysis would be based around understanding the drivers for male majority ridership.  I'd also recommend looking into the cost of parking and ridership to determine any patterns.  One of the insights I'd like to understand is analysis for socio-economic status that may drive the ridership in neighborhoods.
